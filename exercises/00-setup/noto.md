# EPFL Noto

EPFL provides a centralized JupyterLab platform for students called [Noto](https://www.epfl.ch/education/educational-initiatives/jupyter-notebooks-for-education/one-click-access-to-jupyter-notebooks-online-with-noto/), allowing you to run all these notebooks without having to install anything on your computer. This is because those notebooks are running in the cloud (i.e. on a remote server, with which you directly interact through the JupyterLab interface).

To clone this repo on EPFL Noto, click on this link: https://go.epfl.ch/civil226-introml-2024-noto .

As in a local Python installation, you will need to frequently `git pull` the most recent changes in order to ensure that your files are up-to-date.

:warning: You'll need a stable internet connection to run these labs through Noto, as it runs in the cloud. This is not the case when running the notebooks locally, even though we're still using a web browser to access Jupyter Lab.

## Other cloud-based notebook platforms

There exists other online platforms offering cloud-based Jupyter Notebooks. Notably:

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which offers free GPU runtimes, which is very useful for some machine learning tasks (such as training neural networks).
- [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/), which offers real-time collaboration (useful for group projects).

**Note**: These platforms may have missing packages at first. Follow the platform's documentation to figure out how to install them if that is the case.
