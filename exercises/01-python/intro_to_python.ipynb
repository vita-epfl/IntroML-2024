This is especially true because of the selection of **libraries and frameworks**, developed specifically for machine learning and scientific computing. To name a few, you have Keras, TensorFlow and PyTorch for developing neural networks, SciPy and NumPy used for scientific computing, Pandas for data analysis, etc. (You might also get to dabble in PyTorch in the upcoming weeks.)\n",
