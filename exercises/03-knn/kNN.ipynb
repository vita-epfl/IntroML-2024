    "The classifier seems to perform well for both distance metrics and for values of k ranging from 1 to 50, but it is hard to pinpoint which value of k is optimal, and which distance metric is better. This is why, for small datasets, it is often preferred to use [K-Fold Cross Validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#k-fold_cross-validation) instead of just a single validation set, as it provides more accurate results and is less sensitive to noise. You will see how to implement cross-validation later in this course. For now, just select a value of k and a distance metric that provides good result."
